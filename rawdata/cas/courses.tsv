CAS	PO	152	None	The rise of China, unrest in Turkey and the Arab world, and the recent crisis of the euro zone are all  examples of the rapid changes taking place in politics and government around the world. While these  changes have major consequences for our lives through means as diverse as greater economic  competition or terrorism, we struggle to make sense of them. We don't easily grasp the motives and  thinking of the rulers of countries such as Iran or understand how major powers such as China and  Russia are governed. We have hopes that more of the world's population will be governed by liberal  democratic political systems but try to understand the challenges in bringing about such regime  changes. The field of Comparative Politics gives you the information, concepts, and theories needed to address these issues. The small class setting provided in this course offers the opportunity for plenty of  discussion and debate on the material we cover.
